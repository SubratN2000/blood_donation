    <h1>GENERAL DONOR ASSESSMENT</h1><br><br><br></center>
    <h3>Only individuals in good health should be accepted as blood donors. Good health is difficult to define, but certain associated parameters may be established from a brief medical history, observation and simple tests. Staff undertaking donor health and risk assessment should be well-trained in the observation of donor appearance and detection of signs of ill health. Staff should receive explicit guidance on what to look for and when to refer a donor to a health-care professional for further medical attention.

Donors should feel well on the day of donation and be able to perform their routine daily activities. Information about minor illnesses, exposure to communicable diseases, travel to disease endemic areas, pregnancy and lactation and medical and surgical interventions should be elicited so as to determine suitability for blood donation or the need for deferral. The BTS physician may request additional information and advice about the health of a prospective donor from the donor's own doctor or specialist.

Sections 4, 5, 6 and 7 contain recommendations on acceptance and deferral of donors based on selection criteria which fall into four broad categories:
<BR>
- Conditions that are acceptable<BR>
- Conditions that require temporary deferral for defined periods of time<BR>
- Conditions that require permanent deferral<BR>
- Conditions that require individual assessment.</h3>
<br><br><br><BR><BR><center>
    <h1>DONOR APPEARANCE AND INSPECTION</h1><br><br><br></center>
    <h3>The prospective donor should appear generally well and should not be febrile, breathless or suffering from a persistent cough. Donors should be observed to rule out malnutrition or any debilitating condition. They should have a sound mental status and not be under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

The colour of exposed skin and mucous membranes should be normal, with no jaundice, cyanosis, flushing or pallor, and no signs of skin infection, rash or obviously enlarged lymph nodes. If body piercings or tattoos are present, the risk of transfusion-transmissible infections (TTI) should be assessed (also refer to Section 7.9.5 on cosmetic treatments and rituals).

The venepuncture site should be clean, free from any skin lesions or scars and the arms should be examined for signs of injecting drug use. Antecubital veins should be easily visible or palpable to enable proper venepuncture, thus avoiding any discomfort to the donor and minimizing the risk of major bruises or other soft tissue injury at the venepuncture site.

Donors with sight or hearing impairment may be accepted provided clear and confidential communication can be established. If assistance is required, it should be provided by a staff member or other independent person and not a family member or friend.
<BR>
Recommendation<BR>
- Prospective donors should be accepted only if they appear to be in good health and comply with donor selection criteria</h3>
<br><br><br><BR><BR><center>
    <h1>MINOR ILLNESSES</h1><br><br><br></center>
    <h3>Minor non-specific symptoms (e.g. general malaise, pain, fever, headache, cough, diarrhoea) may indicate the presence of an acute infection that may be transmissible by transfusion. Donors should be asked to confirm that they are free from such symptoms on the day of donation and that they have fully recovered from any recent infection(s). Individuals suffering from minor illnesses and not feeling well should not donate blood.

There is no evidence that minor infections such as common upper respiratory infections can be transmitted by transfusion, but it is nevertheless advisable as a precautionary measure to defer blood donation until any such infection has resolved (65).<BR>
Recommendation<BR>
- Individuals with a history of recent infection: defer for 14 days following full recovery and cessation of any therapy, including antibiotics</h3>
